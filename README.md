# Hey!

I'm a Fullstack Blockchain Developer with 5+ years of experience, passionate about Web3, smart contracts, and building scalable decentralized apps on EVM blockchains.

I love learning new things, pushing my limits, and turning ideas into real projects.
Right now, I'm working on several EVM-based projects, mixing backend magic with modern frontend craft to build secure, user-friendly dApps.

Always coding, always learning â€” and always excited about whatâ€™s next in Web3
